## Bincom Project

Welcome to the **Bincom Project** documentation. This project contains various Python scripts designed for different computational tasks, such as data extraction, number generation, and recursive searching.

## Overview

This project consists of several scripts that perform specific tasks. Below is a brief description of each file included in this repository:

- **bincom\_dev.py** - Extracts table content from `bincom.html` and creates a structured dictionary.
- **bincom.html** - HTML file containing the table data.
- **generate\_random\_binary.py** - Generates a random 4-digit binary number and converts it to decimal.
- **mean\_color.py** - Analyzes the color data and calculates statistical insights.
- **recursive\_search.py** - Implements a recursive search algorithm.
- **sum\_fibonacci.py** - Computes the sum of the first 50 Fibonacci numbers.
